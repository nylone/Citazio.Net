# Citazio.Net

## Foreword
[citazio.net](https://citazio.net) is a project developed during free time and for fun.

**We appreciate and welcome feedback of any form**.

As you may notice during a read-through of this document, the API may be subject to change in the future. **We're currently in a testing stage** so please: don't attempt to deploy this project thinking that its production ready

We recognise that a backend running on [Node](https://nodejs.org) is not particularly enticing to some. In the future we plan to rewrite the backend and release it as a single binary to aid with its deployment.

## Structure of the docs
The docs are split in:
- How to **install** and **host** (WIP)
- How to interact with the **API** (WIP)
- How to **backup** and **restore** the site data (WIP)

## Tools used
At its current stage, citazio.net is written using [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) for its frontend, with the aid of [Fastify](https://fastify.dev) for the back end.
